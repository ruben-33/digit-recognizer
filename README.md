# Digit-recognizer
Digit recognizer using keras dataset.
# Introduction
 - import the necessary dependencies:
  . pandas
  . numpy
  . tensorflow
  . keras - keras.datasets
  . matplotlib
 - the dataset will be uploaded from keras.dataset.mnist.
# Body
 - divide the dataset into training and testing.
 - scale or normalize the data.
 - create a convolutional neural network model using tensorflow and keras.
 - fit the model for both train and test data.
# Finally
 - using CNN modelling, the accuarcy obtained is around 100%.
